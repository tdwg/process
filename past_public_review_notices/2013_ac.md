Audubon Core Public Review

By: Steve Baskauf, Review Manager

Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) announces the Public Review of
the proposed Audubon Core Multimedia Resources Metadata Standard.
Audubon Core is designed to provide a controlled vocabulary to address
the management, acquisition, and content descriptions of biodiversity
multimedia. It is a product of the Joint GBIF- TDWG Multimedia
Resources Task Group (MRTG) and has undergone peer review, several
revisions, and review by the TDWG Executive Committee. If you are a
potential producer or consumer of metadata for biodiversity-related
multimedia, we would like your input on this proposed TDWG Technical
Specification Standard.

You may find it easiest to view the proposed standard online. The
following links lead to the three parts of the standard:

    the non-normative introduction:
    http://terms.gbif.org/wiki/Audubon_Core_Non_Normative_Document

    the normative introductory material:
    http://terms.gbif.org/wiki/Audubon_Core_(1.0_normative)

    the normative term list:
    http://terms.gbif.org/wiki/Audubon_Core_Term_List_(1.0_normative)


A downloadable zip archive containing the proposed standard can be
obtained at http://www.tdwg.org/standards/638/ . This archive includes
an informative adoption and sustainability plan which is not an official
part of the proposed standard.

To raise specific issues or to make specific recommendations, use the
issues tracker described at
http://code.google.com/p/auduboncore/wiki/AboutIssueTracker . To engage
in general discussion about the standard, join the TDWG email list
(tdwg-content) by subscribing at
http://lists.tdwg.org/mailman/listinfo/tdwg-content . You can then post
messages to tdwg-content at lists.tdwg.org . Issues raised in that
conversation may be added to the issue tracker as well. Comments about
the proposed standard will be archived as a part of the standards
adoption process.

In accordance with the TDWG standards process, a minimum of 30 days is
required for public comment on the proposed standard. Comments should
therefore be received by 1st April 2013. For more information about the
TDWG standards process, see
http://www.tdwg.org/standards/status-and-categories/ and
http://www.tdwg.org/about-tdwg/process/ .

Please distribute this call for comment to anyone you think could or
should comment on Audubon Core. You may address any questions about the
review process to me at steve.baskauf at vanderbilt.edu .

Thanks to the authors, Robert A. Morris (convenor), Vijay Barve, Mihail
Carausu, Vishwas Chavan, Jose Cuadra, Chris Freeland, Gregor Hagedorn,
Patrick Leary, Dimitry Mozzherin, Annette Olson, Greg Riccardi, and Ivan
Teage for their work on the proposed standard. Thanks also to the
anonymous reviewers, the Executive Committee, and Lee Belbin who served
previously as Review Manager for the standard.

# Completion of Audubon Core public review

More than the minimum 30 days required for the public review of Audubon
Core have passed and I've received comments from everyone who told me
that they planned to comment. I am therefore closing the public review
period. The review guidelines at
http://www.tdwg.org/fileadmin/documentation/guidance_docs/ReviewManagerGuidelines.doc
require that Public Review comments be visible to all. Since many of
the comments I received were emailed directly to me rather than to the
tdwg-content list or posted on the Issues Tracker, I've posted a digest
of the comments at
http://code.google.com/p/auduboncore/wiki/RecordOfPublicReview for
public inspection.

As a result of these comments, a number of issues have been opened by
commenters or by me based on the submitted comments. These issues can
be viewed at the Audubon Core Issue Tracker
http://code.google.com/p/auduboncore/issues/list

I would like to thank everyone who took the time to read the
specification and comment. I think that the standard will be
strengthened based on your comments and look forward to working with the
authors to implement many of your suggestions.
