# Public Review Begins for our Draft Vocabulary Documentation and Maintenance Standards

(from the [Feb 2017 Newsletter](https://us9.campaign-archive.com/?u=50f3cc44307841383062ca0d6&id=6f626d304b&e=d762e08a1e))


In 2015, the Vocabulary Specification Task Group was established, with Steve Baskauf as Convener, and charged with developing specifications for documenting and maintaining vocabulary standards. The Documentation Specification will proscribe the format of human- and machine-readable documents that form TDWG (vocabulary) standards, and will supersede the current unratified draft specification for documenting a standard. The Vocabulary Maintenance Specification proscribes the process by which TDWG vocabularies will be modified and amended. That specification was based on the current Change Policy of the Darwin Core Namespace, and what has been learned from its application. If ratified, it will apply to all current and future TDWG vocabularies. These draft standards passed expert review last Fall and are now ready for public review. Please find the specifications and the supporting documents in Vocab repository of our GitHub site. Begin with the README.md file. Please submit any comments, questions, or criticisms as "issues" in the issue tracker. If you would like to register an issue anonymously, please send it via email to the review manager, Dag Endresen. Public review will be open at least through Mar 27th, and may be extended if a valuable discussion is on-going. The results of public review will be summarized and published shortly thereafter.
